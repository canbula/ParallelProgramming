First of all I want you to know that your contributions are welcome.

You can commit your work every week to the folders WeekXX through the semester.

Be sure that you have forked the original repository, and then create your file in your own forked repository.

When you are ready to submit your file, commit your changes and then open a pull request.

Your pull request will be reviewed by me and if there exist some tests will be run on your code.

If there are some points that need to be changed in your code then I will send you a change request.

If everything is ok, then I will merge your commit.

Thanks a lot for your contributions. I hope this will be a good course for you.
