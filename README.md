# Parallel Programming 2023
Repository for Parallel Programming course given by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Bora Canbula 
at Computer Engineering Department of Manisa Celal Bayar University.

# Course Information
This course is about parallel programming using Python. Students will learn the basic concepts 
of parallel programming like threads, processes, and distributed systems. They will also learn 
how to use Locks, Semaphores, and Queues to synchronize threads and processes. Course starts 
with a brief introduction to Python and then continues with the asynchronous programming using 
asyncio. In the following sections, students will learn how to create multithread and multiprocess 
applications. Finally, students will learn how to create distributed applications using cluster 
computing with containers. You can find some supplementary videos for this course on my YouTube channel.

# Weekly Content
You can find the codes that written in the laboratory in the folder WeekXX.

# Lecture Notes and Problem Sets
In the root folder there is a LectureNotes.pdf file, which is updated weekly after every lecture.

# Codes and Videos from Previous Years
You can change the branch to see the codes from previous years. Also there is a YouTube playlist, 
which includes the supplementary videos for the course as given in 2021. The videos do not include 
the introductory Python and asynchronous programming part, so they start from Week06.
